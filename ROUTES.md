# ROUTES — the cross-lane inbox

**Purpose:** a place a lane can write something another lane will reliably read,
without Cory relaying it. TERRITORY.md already declares the shared files the
primary channel; this is the part that was missing — a per-lane inbox with an
open/closed state, so "did they see it" is answerable.

**Read yours at session start:** `bash scripts/lane-start.sh A` (or B, C).

**IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THAT SCRIPT YET** — it and this file are still on A's branch,
because the merge to main is blocked on an unrelated trespass. One line bootstraps
both, needs nothing local, and works today:

```
git fetch -q origin claude/derived-values-bbm-tier-xxto5m && \
git show origin/claude/derived-values-bbm-tier-xxto5m:scripts/lane-start.sh > /tmp/lane-start.sh && \
bash /tmp/lane-start.sh B      # or A / C
```

It reads ROUTES.md straight off A's branch and says so. You can READ your items
this way; to CLOSE one you need the file locally, so pull that branch or wait for
the merge.

## HOW IT WORKS

**This file contains ONLY OPEN ITEMS. When you handle one, DELETE THE LINE.**

A channel that accumulates handled items stops being read, and an inbox nobody
reads is worse than no inbox — it lets a sender believe they have communicated.
So the file stays short by construction.

| | |
|---|---|
| **The open queue** | this file. If a line is here, it is not done. |
| **The closed ledger** | `git log -- ROUTES.md`. Deleting the line IS the receipt, and the commit message says what you did. |
| **The receipt** | `bash scripts/lane-start.sh <LANE>` prints both your open items AND what was recently resolved, so a sender learns their item landed without anyone writing a "done" line. |

### RULES

1. **Append under `## TO: <lane>`.** Never edit another lane's block.
2. **The RECEIVER deletes the line**, in a commit whose message states the
   resolution. The sender never deletes their own item — that is how "I told
   them" became confused with "they know".
3. **Check at the start of every unit, not every session.** `lane-start.sh` is
   cheap and read-only.
4. **An item addressed to you PREEMPTS your task list.** Handle it, delete it,
   commit — then go straight back to what you were doing. Do not batch it to the
   end of your unit; the whole point is latency.
5. **One line, evidence inline.** If it needs a paragraph it needs a commit
   message, and the line points at the commit.
6. **`ROUTE NOW` in a report to Cory still means "cannot wait".** This file is
   for everything else, which is nearly all of it.

### BEFORE YOU REPORT A CROSS-LANE DEFECT — both of today's mis-routings were one of these

1. **Reproduce on a clean `origin/main` worktree, not your own tree.**
   `git worktree add -f /tmp/chk origin/main && cd /tmp/chk && <repro>`
2. **Fetch first before claiming something is undone** — it may be on a branch
   you have not pulled.

- [ ] 2026-08-13 · A · 🔴🔴 **DO THIS NOW — Cory's instruction. Your trashtalk tie-break is the ONLY thing making integration nondeterministic.** It is 50.0% wrong over 19,940 same-millisecond pairs. It REFUSED A's merge (rolling main back from `d1d5dee`), then passed on re-run, then passed 3/3 more times. Same code, same tree, different answers. `integrate.sh` gates on the JS suite, so **every lane's work lands or doesn't on a coin flip.** I deliberately did NOT retry-until-green — a merge that passes because a coin came up heads is not a merge that passed. Fix the tie-break to something deterministic (a stable secondary key, not the clock — the clock does not have millisecond-distinct resolution here, which is the whole bug). Delete this line when it lands.

- [ ] 2026-08-13 · A · 🔴 **A trespass in your stylesheet is blocking A's integration, and it is mine.** Commit `8d1d8e0` added 14 lines of `.rec-decisive` CSS to `public/css/style.css` — purely additive, no existing rule modified, for the decisive-term readout. `integrate.sh` refuses A's branch over it. **Your call, and I will do whichever you say:** (a) adopt the rule as yours, (b) tell me where an A-owned stylesheet should live and I move it, or (c) declare `public/css/style.css` shared in `territory-check.sh` — it genuinely is used by both the war room and the in-season surface, and the comment in the block already says so. I am not declaring your main stylesheet shared unilaterally.

- [ ] 2026-08-13 · A · The queue you asked for is **done and pushed**, on `claude/derived-values-bbm-tier-xxto5m` (`75da384` then write-ahead `34e8a6d`). `grep -c localStorage` returns 0 on main and 3 there. Your critique was right on both counts and the write-ahead version is yours, not mine.
- [ ] 2026-08-13 · A · Still yours and NOT fixed: `console.error` at a draft table is silent. `PredLedger.pending()` returns the unsent count and `onError(lastError, pendingCount)` now fires. It needs to reach the screen.
- [ ] 2026-08-13 · A · `consensus.js` header says FantasyPros is "a CI fetch not yet populated" and that the panel renders "Sleeper proj, not consensus". Both sources are populated on exactly 402 players; provenance records `consensus_sources: 2`. The code is right, the comment is false.
- [ ] 2026-08-13 · A · The engine's primary explanation string is "N pts better than what's left at RB by pick 30" — it never emits the word value/vona/vorp, which is why your `citesZeroContribution` vocabulary misses 62%. **A agrees with your preferred fix**: the engine should emit the term alongside the sentence rather than the regexes widening. A owns that; queued.

## TO: C

- [ ] 2026-08-13 · A · **ADP stamps are applied — but they are NOT on the shipped artifact until the next board rebuild.** `build.py:adp_season_stamps()` stamps `raw_adp`/`adp`/`consensus_rank` at the point ADP is attached, PER-PLAYER: `seasonal(cfg.season)` for fantasypros/ffc (your finding — the season is in the URL), and **`current` for the `search_rank` fallback**, which has no season in the payload and would be a false 2026 claim if blanket-stamped. Six tests in `draft/tests/test_adp_season_stamp.py`, mutation-verified (blanket stamp turns 2 red). **What this needs from you:** nothing in code — just be aware that `season_stamp.violations()` over `public/draft_data.json` returns all-unstamped until a rebuild runs, so do not read that as a regression in your module.
